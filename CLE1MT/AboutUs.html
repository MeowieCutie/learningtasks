		<h2><div class="m">Mission</h2>
		<p> 
		Our aim is to meet the fundamental requirements of individuals who cannot care for themselves and to assist them in becoming self-sufficient and living a good, dignified life. The objective is for these communities to be able to continue to offer health and education services to their own populations and children.

		<h2> <div class="v"> Vision </h2>
		<p> 
		Our long-term goal is to eliminate poverty in the country as soon as feasible. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the Philippines will be a thriving, mostly middle-class or upper-class society in which no one is impoverished or hungry.

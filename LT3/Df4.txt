The Dolan DF4 builds upon the success of its predecessor, the game-changer that was the DF3. Having shattered world records and been the winner of over 80 World and European Championship races we’ve returned to the drawing board to dream it all up again.The DF4 has the same geometry as the DF3 but has been engineered for improved performance and handling. 115g lighter and 18% stiffer, we targetted those all-important areas in track cycling where the differences are really made. In a bike design streamlined for performance, in an aero design that’s UCI approved, the DF4 cuts through the air in the heat of competition.

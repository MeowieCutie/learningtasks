    <h2> <div class="title2"> Poverty: The main unresolved issue in the Philippines </div></h2>
        <p> Poverty is the the state of being extremely poor. The Philippines has a fairly high poverty rate with more than 16% of the population living below the poverty line. Because of the many people reliant on agriculture for an income and inequality in wealth distribution, about 17.6 million Filipinos struggle to afford basic necessities.Furthermore, the government has implemented various programs and reforms to reduce poverty by targeting education, healthcare and the overall economy. And yet, why is poverty still present in the Philippines?

		Economic growth has gone through boom and bust cycles, and recent episodes of moderate economic expansion have had limited impact on the poor. Great inequality across income brackets, regions, and sectors, as well as unmanaged population growth, are considered some of the key factors constraining poverty reduction efforts.
        <br><br>
		The first six months of last year saw 3.9 million more Filipinos pushed into poverty, with economic officials laying the blame squarely on pandemic-related lockdown measures, job losses, cuts in household consumption, and forced business closures. Poverty in the country grew to 23.7%, against 21.1% in the same six-month period in 2018.
        <br><br>
		The country has experienced two major waves of confirmed infections, with cases peaking in April 2021 and again five months later in September. Of the 2.8 million confirmed cases in the country since the pandemic began, 2.7 million people have recovered, while over 51,000 people have died. 
        <br><br>
        The First Semester 2021 poverty incidence among population, or the proportion of poor Filipinos whose per capita income is not sufficient to meet their basic food and non-food needs, was estimated at 23.7 percent. This translates to 26.14 million Filipinos who lived below the poverty threshold estimated at PhP 12,082, on the average, for a family of five per month in the first semester of 2021. On the other hand, subsistence incidence among Filipinos, or the proportion of Filipinos whose income is not enough to meet even the basic food needs, was registered at 9.9 percent or about 10.94 million Filipinos in the first semester of 2021. On the average, the monthly food threshold for a family of five for the same period was estimated at PhP 8,393.
        <br><br>
		Among families, the First Semester 2021 poverty incidence was estimated at 18.0 percent, which is equivalent to around 4.74 million poor families. Meanwhile, the subsistence incidence among families was recorded at 7.1 percent, or around 1.87 million food poor families in the first semester of 2021.Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua said the nation's poverty incidence rate goal for 2022 — the proportion of Filipinos whose per capital income is insufficient to meet basic food and non-food needs —  will remain at 15.5% to 17.5%.
        <br><br>
        Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte aims to reduce the rate of poverty to 14% by 2022. Through its strategy, AmBisyon 2040, the Philippine government plans to eradicate extreme poverty by 2040.

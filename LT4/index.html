	<p>We met I fell for you <br>
	It was hard to believe<br>
That you liked me too<br>
The idea was so hard to concieve<br>
<br>
<br>
Why such a beautiful woman<br>
Would fall for a guy like me<br>
Then I heard from the good man<br>
He said "I had someone for you to see"<br>
<br>
<br>
So I began to thank God above<br>
Because you are everything I need<br>
He sent me a Godly woman to love<br>
To protect, and lead.<br>
<br>
<br>
You are the one my maker sent<br>
And you are the one I will always love<br>
So to hurt you will never be my intent<br>
Like Boaz and Ruth we fit like a glove.
